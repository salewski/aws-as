This is the 'NEWS' file for the 'aws-as' project. This file contains
information on changes since the last release of the package, as well as a
running list of high-level changes from previous versions.  If critical bugs
are found in any of the software, notice of such bugs and the versions in
which they were fixed will be noted here, as well.

* aws-as 0.1.0 (TBD)

  This is the initial release of the 'aws-as' project.

  The 'aws-as' project provides a collection of tools for switching between
  cached sets of AWS IAM User and/or Role credentials when working at the
  command line.

FIXME: document these someplace:

  The aws-cli configuration does not directly support storing the MFA serial
  number for non-Role profiles. If a profile has an 'mfa_serial' key, then it
  is expected to have a 'role_arn' key, as well; you will get an error if you
  have an 'mfa_serial' key in the section for a non-Role profile.

  However, the 'aws-cli configuration' subcommand is sufficiently general that
  it /will/ allow us to store (nearly) arbitrary key/value pairs in the
  file. We therefore claim the namespace prefix "aws_as_" for keys related to
  'aws-as'.

  Currently there is only one key with the 'aws_as_' prefix:

  :    aws_as_mfa_serial

  We use this key to store the MFA serial number for the device associated
  with an IAM User.

  :    $ aws --profile my-user-with-mfa configure set aws_as_mfa_serial 'arn:aws:iam::111111111111:mfa/my-username'

  :    $ aws --profile my-user-with-mfa configure get aws_as_mfa_serial
  :    arn:aws:iam::111111111111:mfa/my-username

  The 'aws_as_mfa_serial' key is only needed for profiles used for IAM Users
  that need to authenticate (to STS) with MFA; it is never needed for profiles
  used for IAM Roles (see below).

  The 'aws-as' program looks (in a given profile) for the keys defined by
  aws-cli ('role_arn' and 'mfa_serial') first, and only falls back to checking
  the profile for the 'aws_as_mfa_serial' key if /neither/ is found. The
  reason is that the presence of the 'role_arn' means the aws-cli program will
  interpret the profile as representing an IAM Role to be assumed (so is not
  for an IAM User); using the 'mfa_serial' key would be the proper way to
  configure such a profile to use MFA, if needed.

  Users of 'aws-as' that need (or wish) to authenticate to STS as an IAM User,
  with MFA, should configure an aws-cli profile with the 'aws_as_mfa_serial'
  key as shown above. This will avoid the need to provide it on the command
  line.
